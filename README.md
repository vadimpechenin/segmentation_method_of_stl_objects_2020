# segmentation_method_of_stl_objects_2020
Implementation program for segmentation methods for faces of a stl object

The segmentation method is taken from the work of Lavou, Guillaume "A new 
curvature tensor based segmentation method for optimized triangulated CAD meshes"

The calculation of the criticality on which the method is based is partly taken 
from Mark Meyer "Discrete Differential-Geometry Operators for Triangulated 2-Manifolds"
and function written by D.Kroon University of Twente (August 2011).
